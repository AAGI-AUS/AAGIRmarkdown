This R package contains RMarkdown templates that AAGI staff can use to
create AAGI-themed documents and presentations. Installing the R package
allows RStudio users to easily set up new AAGI reports via the graphical
menus (_File&rarr;New File&rarr;R Markdown_), and also via the R console
using the following functions:

- `new_report()`, 
- `new_interim_report()`,
- `new_presentation()`, 
- `new_document()`.
