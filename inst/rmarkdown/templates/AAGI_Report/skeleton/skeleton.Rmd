# Executive Summary {-}

Executive summary goes here. Summarise the work that was provided by AAGI and
the main results. (Try to limit this to a single page.)

# Introduction

The report body text goes here.

Note that the following section titles are provided as a guide, but feel free
to modify them in any way that you like if they are not relevant to your work
of if using a different set of titles enhances the readability of your report.

Use AAGI theme colours for emphasis:

- Use \verb|\textcolor{aagiteal}{...}| for \textcolor{aagiteal}{AAGI teal},
- Use \verb|\textcolor{aagigreen}{...}| for \textcolor{aagigreen}{AAGI green},
- Use \verb|\textcolor{aagiblack}{...}| for \textcolor{aagiblack}{AAGI black}.

Use \verb|[@blah]| for parenthetical citations: [@blah]. Use \verb|@blah|
for text citations, e.g. @blah. References should be entered in bibtex
format in the \texttt{references.bib} file.

You can use \verb|\begin{note} ... \end{note}|
for emphatic notes throughout the report if you like. You can use
\verb|\faIcon{...}| to add FontAwesome icons for decoration, as shown below.

\begin{note}
  {\sbf\color{aagiteal!75!black} \faIcon{exclamation-triangle} NOTE}\quad
  This is an example of a note.
\end{note}

Use code chunks to embed R code and analytics results:

```{r mycodechunk}
#| echo=TRUE, eval=TRUE
1 + 2
```

You can use the \texttt{AAGIThemes} package to give a consistent style to
your charts and graphics:

```{r mygraph}
#| echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE,
#| fig.height=3, fig.width=6, fig.pos="H",
#| fig.cap="My figure"
library(ggplot2)
library(AAGIThemes)

ggplot(pressure) + 
  geom_point(aes(x = temperature, y = pressure)) +
  theme_aagi()
```

Use \texttt{kable} for producing tables. For convenience, you can use the
`aagi_table()` wrapper function to quickly give your table a basic 
AAGI theme and header colour, but feel free to modify to your taste:

```{r mytable}
#| echo=TRUE
aagi_table(head(iris, 4), caption = "My table")
```


\vspace*{1cm}

In this introduction section, outline the goals of the research project and
any necessary background to provide contexts and rationale for the
research/work.

## This is a subsection

Use subsections (and subsubsections) as much as you like to help structure
your content.

### This is a subsubsection


\clearpage
# Trial design

Include the trial layout, type, and the experimental design, such as treatments,
number of replicates, blocking, etc. Include graphics and pictures where useful.

Make sure to include notes about any specific considerations that must be kept
in mind for the type of trial (e.g., small plots, glasshouse experiments,
genetics, breeding trials, OFE projects, bioinformatics projects, and so on).


\clearpage
# Exploratory data analysis

You can use a dedicated section here for the preliminary data exploration and
dataset visualisation. This can be useful to aid in the interpretation of the
data and graphs generated throughout the work, as well as for providing a
rationale for the statistical methodologies used.


\clearpage
# Methods

Use this section to include a detailed description of the procedures and
methodologies used for the analysis. Include versions/commits on developed
pipelines, code scripts, and input/output details as relevant.

Detail also the approach taken for the data analysis work here (or in a
separate section).


\clearpage
# Results and discussion

Include all of the results of the analytical work, and discuss the findings
and their implications with respect to the research question.


\clearpage
# Datasets and metadata

(Optional) Where useful, include descriptions of the datasets relevant to
this research, including links and DOIs to enable findability of these datasets.
(Often for GRDC projects these will have associated metadata entries in the GRDC
Data Catalogue, which can be linked where appropriate.)

Where you have publicly available code on GitHub associated with the analytics
(e.g., pipelines), you can include git commit numbers and tags. Including
md5/sha256 checksums for input data and outputs is also useful for
research reproducibility.


\clearpage
# Trial location maps

(Optional) Include if relevant to the project.


\clearpage
\appendix

\clearpage
# This is an appendix

Include Appendices at the end of the report as necessary, to contain any
additional supporting information of interest.

## This is an appendix subsection


\clearpage
# This is another appendix

And so on. Include as many appendices as you like.
